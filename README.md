# PCM Repository
## Overview
This repository accompanies the research article *"Deep Learning for Property Prediction and Optimization of Natural-Fiber Polymer Composites."* It provides open access to the experimental dataset and supporting resources used in the study.

## Contents
The repository includes:
- A structured dataset containing physical and mechanical properties of textile-reinforced polymer composites.
- Features such as:
  - Fiber type (e.g., flax, cotton, sisal, hemp)
  - Matrix material (PLA, PP, epoxy)
  - Surface treatment (untreated, alkaline, silane)
  - Processing conditions (extrusion, molding)
- Target properties:
  - Tensile strength  
  - Elongation at break  
  - Compressive modulus  
  - Impact toughness  
  - Density  

## Purpose
The dataset was curated to support machine learning applications in materials science, particularly for the prediction of composite behavior based on composition and processing. It is suitable for:
- Training and benchmarking regression models
- Sensitivity and feature importance analyses
- Exploring structureâ€“property relationships in natural-fiber composites
